# Radix Themes Datepicker

I love radix themes, sadly it does not provide a datepicker.

I think [react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker) is a solid package, but it's ugly by default.

I have styled it to be compatible with the radix theme you might already be using, and compatible with dark mode.

_I will build a npm package when I have time, not sure if this is useful to anyone other than myself._
